### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is one of the basic skills that one must have when thinking about writing a program. Even if you're just writing it yourself, for yourself, you still need to interpret your thoughts and turn your ideas into concrete information that you can work with. This skill is invaluable, and there are many ways to do this, depending on what works best for you. When interpreting the needs of users who are not yourself, communication is key. You always have to be on the same page with your users. Ask questions, be specific, and ask for clarification when needed. User stories are a really good way to format these things on paper, because it turns these details into concrete information that you can then use to write your program.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When first thinking about developing a program, it typically involves lots of thinking, but also lots of writing code. I tend to think as I work, and adapt as needed based on new information that I discover during the process of writing code. This is, I believe, an agile process in and of itself that I incorporate into my work naturally, and will continue to do so as long as I write code.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
The first thing that comes to mind is maturity. Maturity is everything, really. You need to hold yourself accountable, and treat those around you with respect. Use "common sense" and think critically, always. The second thing that is really important is communication. Communication is the key to a lot of things, and can never hurt. Communicate with your team members if you have questions, concerns, or even to offer assistance. The more you communicate, the more you will learn from, teach, and connect with your friends and colleagues.
