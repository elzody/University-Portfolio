### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is one of the basic skills that one must have when thinking about writing a program. Even if you're just writing it yourself, for yourself, you still need to interpret your thoughts and turn your ideas into concrete information that you can work with. This skill is invaluable, and there are many ways to do this, depending on what works best for you. When interpreting the needs of users who are not yourself, communication is key. You always have to be on the same page with your users. Ask questions, be specific, and ask for clarification when needed. User stories are a really good way to format these things on paper, because it turns these details into concrete information that you can then use to write your program.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When first thinking about developing a program, it typically involves lots of thinking, but also lots of writing code. I tend to think as I work, and adapt as needed based on new information that I discover during the process of writing code. This is, I believe, an agile process in and of itself that I incorporate into my work naturally, and will continue to do so as long as I write code.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
The first thing that comes to mind is maturity. Maturity is everything, really. You need to hold yourself accountable, and treat those around you with respect. Use "common sense" and think critically, always. The second thing that is really important is communication. Communication is the key to a lot of things, and can never hurt. Communicate with your team members if you have questions, concerns, or even to offer assistance. The more you communicate, the more you will learn from, teach, and connect with your friends and colleagues.

### Project Three
The goal of this project was to use Python and C++ side-by-side in order to develop an application that processes a text file of items, calculates the frequency that each item appears, and displays a histogram of the data. It allows you to display the item names and their corresponding frequency, search for a specific item (displaying only that item and its frequency), or display a histogram of all items and their frequencies. Most of this processing happens via Python, but C++ is also an important component in handling the data passed from Python and displaying it to the user.

The most challenging aspect of this project was figuring out the best way to calculate the frequency of each item. I opted to simply loop through the list of items and compare each item until all items have been read. It uses a counter to keep track of the number of times a particular item appears, and then passes that data to C++ for use there.

I think the most important thing that I learned from this project is how to use multiple programming languages in the same project. This is something that I'd never really considered before, but I now realize that this is really important knowledge to have. Each language has unique abilities that may pair well with the abilities of another language. You can use this to your advantage and create some really beautiful code.


### The Gaming Room

##### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a game studio that needed guidance in how to implement various components of their game, Draw It or Lose it. The game is currently available on Android devices, but they want to expand it to other platforms. The game is to be built from the ground up with portability in mind, as it runs in a user’s web browser and works even on mobile devices. The game needs to host several thousand sessions and users at a time, and host various asset files and other user data.

##### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did particularly well with breaking down the pros and cons of different operating systems when it comes to choosing a server OS. I am knowledgeable on several different operating platforms, and was very thorough in my considerations.

##### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I used to dislike things like software design documents, but after completing this one, I realized how much it helps with development. For example, creating and analyzing a UML Class Diagram was extremely helpful in understand some of the core concepts of object-oriented programming and how it is used in the game. It provides a very nice guideline that you can use when you begin writing code, and helps paint a clearer picture of the structure of the program.

##### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would likely revise the final section that outlines recommendations. I found it quite difficult to really get into every single recommendation without knowing more about what the client wants specifically, and the other intricate details regarding how they operate and the resources they have available to them. It’s easier when I’m actually involved in the project, rather than looking at it from an outside perspective. Maybe that’s the point of these documents -- to help you get better at this.

##### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user’s needs are essential, because if they aren’t met, no one is going to want to play the game because it makes for a very poor user experience. It shows that you can pay attention to detail, and that you value your client and your customers’ needs. I interpreted these needs and implemented them into the design document by putting myself in the shoes of client or the users. What would I want from this? I think it’s important to ask yourself, and then compare it with your development lifecycle.

##### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I won’t lie, sometimes I just start writing code and see where it takes me, and then once I have a structure I can write up documents and improve from there. This time, however, the document came first. I approached it very cautiously, because I wanted it to be right. I think it was really helpful to get ideas out onto paper and diagrams before writing code, and I think it’s actually more beneficial. In the future I’d like to keep practicing writing such documents, even if they’re meaningless and will never be used. I sometimes struggle with thinking through the ideas first, which is why I need to practice this more.
